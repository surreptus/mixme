          A cocktail we found at the now closed Starline Social Club in Oakland, California. We loved the combination of the Japanese whisky, Drambuie and China China they used. The scotch liquer brings out the honey and the amari adds great vegetal and herb notes to the drink. It'll remind you of an Old Fashioned or a Toronto, but it'll taste something new. We couldn't find China China near us so we took the recommendation of using Amaro Lucano.
