        <p>
          A standard sour cocktail using <a rel='noopener noreferer' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisco'>Pisco</a> as the main spirit. Pisco is a type of brandy
          made in South America, mainly Peru and Chile. Given that, the taste 
          is sweeter, has less heat and wood notes than you'd get with other similar cocktails. You
          can also add some egg whites and do a dry shake for that foam.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Ingredients
        </h3>

        <ul>
          <li>1.5 oz Pisco</li>
          <li>0.75 oz lime juice</li>
          <li>0.75 oz 1:1 simple syrup</li>
          <li>pinch of salt or few drops of saline solution</li>
          <li>1 egg white or 0.75 oz aquafaba</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          How to make it
        </h3>

        <p>
          Get a large shaker tin, fill half way with medium sized ice cubes. Add all ingredients except
          for the egg white to the tin and shake for 30 seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pop the tin, rinse out the empty half, and add the egg white or aquafaba. 
          Double strain the contents into the tin with the egg white and discard 
          the remaining ice. Reseal the tin and shake vigorously for 30 seconds more
          to get as much air into the mixture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Strain into a chilled coupe glass to get the foam as fine as possible. For
          decoration, add three drops of angostaura bitters in a line, and drag a
          pick through then to make small hearts.
